Abstract: Fill it in. Describe what you are going to do, or don’t have an abstract at all.

Purpose: Name a specific disease, or make it clear that this is an average over all diseases. 

Prior work: good description of the SEIR model. How could it ever _not_ be on a graph? You don’t need to have citations for the sake of citations, only include them if they actually add value to your work. Good description of the network model.

Procedure: Fill it in. Allen hates p values, so maybe do some Bayesian regression and give a Bayes factor for him.

Interpretation: Good idea with vaccination strategies, but you may want to note that such any strategy would also need to take into account the inherent design challenge of actually getting people to accept the vaccine. It is also possible that your strategy is over-fitting your data, so you should either mention that, or explain how you mitigated that risk.
